      <h2>Wars of Eredhar: The Dawn of Darkness</h2>
      <p><strong>Status:</strong> Completed (first edition)</p>
      <p><em>The Dawn of Darkness</em> is the first book of the series <strong>Wars of Eredhar</strong>. It is a fantasy novel, taking place in the fictional universe of Eredhar, a world full of secrets, mysteries and adventures.</p>
      <p>Whispers in the night tell of an ancient darkness… That which had once plagued the land has been seen again emerging from the hidden and cold corners of Eredhar. The times of peace are slowly fading away and the war to come will test the boundaries of one's virtues and beliefs, for the tendrils of darkness spread corruption, despair and fear throughout each Eredharian's heart.</p>
      <p>The looming threat will not go unanswered though, for there will be those who rise up against it. But will they be in time… or will the return of the Darkness be the downfall of every kingdom in Eredhar?</p>
